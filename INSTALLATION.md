# Installation

## 1. Position and Mark

Mount a gear on the Motor Cavity Template and find where it sits on the side of the window frame, and mark the location to cut. The blind cord doesn't need to be tight; a little bit of slack is fine.

## 2. Cut Motor Cavity

Cut the hole for the motor in the window frame and ensure that the motor can sit completely inside so that its face is flush with the frame, with space for the motor wires.

Fit the blind cord to the complete assembly and connect the power cable as shown.
